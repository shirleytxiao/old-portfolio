A personal portfolio webpage. 


## Intro

This is a simple webpage for displaying my work and projects, bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## Install

**To run the web app in development mode:**
1. Clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:shirleytxiao/ticket-viewer`
2. Install the application: `npm install`
3. Start the app: `npm start`
4. View in browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

To avoid formatting issues, it is recommended to use the CLI on a full-screen terminal. 
                

## Tests

```sh
npm test
```
